In <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita"">Vladimir Nabokov’s </a><em>Lolita </em>(1955)<em>, </em>Humbert Humbert writes, “I am trying to describe these things not to relive them in my present boundless misery, but to sort out the portion of hell and the portion of heaven in that strange, awful, maddening world—nymphet love. The beastly and beautiful merged at one point, and it is that borderline I would like to fix.” It is precisely this <em>borderline</em> between “monster” and “fancy prose” stylist that we will examine in this course, which will also consider Nabokov’s <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak,_Memory""><em>Speak, Memory: An Autobiography Revisited </em></a>(1951), his research on butterflies, as well as <em><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Enchanter"">The Enchanter</a>, </em>a precursor to <em>Lolita</em>. When <em>Lolita </em>was first published, it was deemed “filthy” yet enjoyed the status as a best-seller, and it continues in the contemporary era to both attract and repel. In addition to reading academic scholarship on <em>Lolita</em>, we will also consider the recently published <a href=""https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/612244/lolita-in-the-afterlife-by-edited-by-jenny-minton-quigley/""><em>Lolita in the Afterlife: On Beauty, Risk, and Reckoning with the Most Indelible and Shocking Novel of the Twentieth Century</em></a> (2021) as well as cultural and cinematic representations or reckonings of the novel.",Jenny Boully,2000,,Fully in-person,4,20,"-To interpret literature through historical, social, cultural, and literary considerations as well as independently through one’s own critical

23358,Analysis,Mathematics,"For the first one hundred and fifty years after its introduction, calculus saw an explosive development in its applications to mathematical and physical problems, defeating old problems thought of as insoluble, and solving new problems no-one had even thought to consider before. At the same time, it was under a cloud of suspicion: it rested on vague arguments about quantities becoming ""infinitely"" small or ""infinitely"" numerous, and though it usually gave correct answers in the end, it was far from the model of logical clarity provided by Euclid's Elements. In this class, you will prove everything that was taken for granted in introductory calculus, starting from first principles. Aside from providing logical certainty, these techniques of proof provide insight as to the real meaning of ""infinitely"" small, ""infinitely"" many, and ""limiting"" value. These techniques are used almost universally in higher mathematics, and a course in Analysis is the central building block of an undergraduate mathematics degree. In addition, the techniques are also essential to theoretical computer science, so students interested in that field should take this course as well.",Kathryn Montovan,4000-level,,Fully in-person,4,16,"In this course, you will:

23601,Computability and Logic,"Computer Science, Science and Mathematics","This is not your typical class in computer science, or in formal logic; but you will learn a lot about both by taking it. Our subject will be one of the most important and influential papers that has ever been written—""On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the <em>Entscheidungsproblem</em>,"" by Alan Turing. This is the paper that birthed computer science as a discipline. Understanding it requires that you be comfortable with some mathematical concepts (powers and roots) and with thinking abstractly; but the most important prerequisite for understanding this paper is determination.

Turing's 1936 paper proves something very interesting. We usually believe we have made progress in solving a mathematical problem when we come up with a general procedure. When you were young, you learned a procedure to subtract one number from another. Later, you learned a procedure to solve for the unknown in a quadratic equation. What Turing shows is that there is a large class of mathematical problems that cannot be solved procedurally. By this, we mean not merely that we do not know what the procedure is, but that no procedure will ever be found!

This is a shocking result! How can we know that no procedure will ever be found? Could it not be that we simply have yet to stumble on the right procedure to solve the problem? No, says Turing! In fact, he proves it, and his mind-bending proof is the centerpiece of our course. His proof lies at the center of three disciplines that have profoundly shaped the modern world: formal logic, foundations of mathematics, and theoretical computer science. Each of these disciplines looks back to Turing's paper as a flashpoint, a moment which defined how each understands reality. What is the best way to characterize Turing's paper? Simple. It changed the world.

In this way, utilitarian objects embody the ideas that define culture. For this class, intermediate and advanced ceramic students will produce prototypes that are a thoughtful response to this problem. The emphasis will be on designing compelling pots rather than producing many matching sets. Students will combine throwing, coil building, slab building, and simple molds to make their pieces. Discussions will address the work's formal and conceptual issues, including design and functionality.

In the first part of the semester, students will explore several key Buddhist texts and forms, and can expect to learn about Buddhist phenomenology and the role of poetry in Buddhist practice, and its contemplative approaches to literary study. We will investigate the lines between so-called sacred and secular literature in the West and how the categories change how we practice exegesis. We will consider literary forms such as the sutra, the gatha, the darani, koan, haiku and haibun alongside Buddhist approaches to reading and writing them, such  as calligraphic meditation, kinhin walking meditation, and <em>plein-air </em>free-style philosophical debate. Specific readings will include “The Heart Sutra,” excerpts from <em>The Diamond Sutra and The Flower Ornament Sutra</em>, an excerpt from the poetic treatise <em>Genjokoan </em>and “Rivers and Mountains  Sutra” by Eihei Dogen, selected koan cases from <em>The Blue Cliff Record </em>and <em>Book of Serenity</em>, and assorted poetry by Chiyo-ni, Buson, Ryokan, Bassho, and Ikkyu, and Sun Buer. From this ground, we will then shift our focus to reading American poets with our own heuristic Buddhist formalist lens which will attempt to craft together. We will read authors who have either directly or indirectly been influenced by East Asian literature or for whom this lens would help to describe an American “mystical” tradition, potentially including Emily Dickinson, WC Williams, Gertude Stein, John Asbbery, Mei-Mei Brussenbrugge, Brandon Shimoda and Filip Marinovich. By the end of the semester, students will have a felt sense of how this comparative contemplative methodology can deepen our understanding of reading poetry, its relationship to contemplative practices such as Buddhism, and of American literary approaches to mysticism.</p>

Marcel Duchamp suggested that Pollock use a canvas instead of painting directly on a wall, ensuring the work could be moved.

It looks pretty big, but exciting as all hell.”</span>

When a painting is too large to fit on an easel, it requires a different approach. We will explore working horizontally on the floor as well as vertically on the wall. One way to approach large-scale work is to imagine the painting under a microscope: at a larger size, every artistic choice is amplified, offering an opportunity to explore facture, gesture, application, and follow-through at a close range. Another strategy we will explore is engaging the whole body in the act of painting. The increased scale provides space to interact more dynamically with the materiality of paint and its physical application.</span>

As we follow the path of microplastics we learn more every day about what plastic does to living organisms. The chemical additives in plastic do not stay put. They leach out into what they touch -- including food, water, air, and human bodies. A large number of these additives are known carcinogens, neurotoxicants, and hormone disruptors, and are associated with a range of disorders from obesity and diabetes to autism and ADHD.

The classical view of particles, mass, and even location break down at the smallest scales. The development of quantum mechanics as a field in the 1920s was a fundamental leap forward for our understanding of atomic physics. Countless current technologies and scientific disciplines rely on the principles predicted by the quantum model. Despite this, quantum mechanics is deeply weird. Particles do not exist solely as particles, but also as waves. Fundamental physical properties such as position, momentum, energy, and time are subject to uncertainties that have nothing to do with measurement precision and everything to do with fundamental universal limits.

This class will feature mostly generative writing in-class as well as lengthy discussions of published work that hoped to push storytelling and prose to an extreme.

24423,Special Topics in Trans Lit: Spirituality,,"“Batter my heart, transgender’d god”
—Meg Day

In this course, we will be reading and writing through work treating spirituality by trans and nonbinary writers. We will read writers from a variety of religious traditions and practices (including atheism), with varying degrees of orthodoxy or heterodoxy. As we do, we will let questions like, “What is the relationship of trans experience to spirituality?” and “How have trans writers used literature to articulate their spiritual experiences?” and “How do our own experiences of gender and spirituality influence our reading?” guide us. Another guiding question: how to thoughtfully and responsibly engage with writers of diverse genders from outside Eurocentric concepts of gender without imposing those concepts? Yet another: what happens when we engage in a critical or scholarly way with a body of work created by people who may share aspects of our own identities?

We will also engage with a variety of forms, from the creative (poetry, fiction, etc.) to the scholarly. We will read work from the anthology <em>Collective Brightness</em>: <em>LGBTIQ Poets on Faith, Religion and Spirituality</em>, as well as selections from books such as <em>ZOM-FAM</em>, in which Kama La Mackerel, “mythologizes a queer/trans narrative of and for their home island, Mauritius,” Joy Ladin’s a <em>Soul of the Stranger</em>: <em>Reading God and Torah from a Transgender Perspective</em>, and <em>The(y)ology</em> by Max Yeshaye Blumberg-Kraus. For a more canonical perspective on trans spirituality, we’ll check out what TSQ (Trans Studies Quarterly, the Trans Studies journal of record) and <em>The Routledge Handbook of Trans Literature</em> have to say on the subject.

Since spiritual practices encompass the ritual as well as the textual, we’ll draw on <em>Jailbreaking the Goddess: a Radical Revisioning of Feminist Spirituality</em> by Lasara Firefox Allen as a way to think about the nuts and bolts of transforming (or creating!) ritual practice and language to encompass the spiritual needs of trans people.

Special Topics in Trans Lit: Spirituality will consist of conversations shaped by close readings of the texts, weekly reading responses, a presentation on one of the readings, and will culminate in a final essay.",Zoe Tuck,2000-level,,Fully in-person,4,20,"·      Gain familiarity with conversations happening in Trans Lit, contemporary creative writing, and Religious Studies

movement. The form is now something we can mold around ourselves with endless possibilities
instead of trying to mold ourselves into the form. We will move, together, to know.

The course will focus on Ballet as an evolving form through attention to expressivity, musicality and even improvisation. Cultural influences on the form will be examined in relation to contemporary dance practices.

This introductory course considers exhibitions that have shaped scholarly and popular conceptions of twentieth-century Western art history. Readings, films, discussions and interactive lectures address styles and ideas within the context of the art spectacle or “show.” Starting with the Armory Show of 1913, we examine art-world machinations as part of economic, political and social shifts. How did players and institutions, from curators and collectors to politicians and the press, combine to elevate certain artists and exhibitions to fame or notoriety? Parallel to looking critically at popular narratives, we examine lesser-known yet equally significant stories and perspectives in the scope of art history. Exhibitions selected for each decade build on each other to give students a cumulative understanding of modernism and postmodernism and sub-movements within them such as Dada, Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, Pop, Conceptual Art, appropriation, identity politics, and institutional critique.

We’ll read 20<sup>th</sup> century writing by authors whose fame was at the time eclipsed by their husbands and partners. We will approach them as writers, thinkers, and activists in their own right, before turning to where their creative and intellectual work meets their conscription in a system of gendered labor. That is, how was these writers’ work influenced by their role as wives? We’ll consider how heteropatriarchal notions about relationship roles extended to the framing and reception of their work. Four of the texts on our reading list are memoir or autobiography: how do gender and sexual roles influence writers choice of form (or rather, what forms were palatable to audiences and publishers)?

We will also be thinking about how race, language, and cultural context influence the idea of the wife. What happens when we apply a wifely optic to queer and trans relationships (e.g. such as those between Etel Adnan and Simone Fattal, Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore, and Leslie Feinberg and Minnie Bruce Pratt).

Nature is often violent and unforgiving, but few understand the extent to which animals engage in behaviors that, if judged by human ethical standards, would be considered malicious, immoral, or even evil. This provocative course will challenge our understanding of morality through the lens of non-human behaviors. Throughout this course, you will uncover the ecological and evolutionary underpinnings of seemingly malevolent behaviors, including predatory play, surplus killing, infanticide and siblicide, traumatic insemination, sexual coercion, sexual cannibalism, brood raiding, brood parasitism, host manipulation, resource hoarding, chemical warfare, inter-colony elimination, and unprovoked lethal violence. We will examine the implications of applying anthropocentric ethical standards to the interpretation of animal behaviors, fostering a nuanced understanding of nature’s diversity. This course is designed for students who are eager to engage with the complexities of animal behavior from a critical and evolutionary perspective. Participants will gain a deep appreciation for the intricacies of the animal world and the ability to critically assess the anthropomorphism of animal actions.

23238,,,"The Scriptorium, a “place for writing,” is a class for writers interested in improving their critical essay-writing skills. We will read to write and write to read. Much of our time will be occupied with writing and revising—<em>essai</em> means “trial” or “attempt”—as we work to create new habits and productive strategies for analytical writing. As we write in various essay structures with the aim of developing a persuasive, well-supported thesis statement, we will also revise collaboratively, improve our research and citation skills, and study grammar and style. We will strive for clarity, concision, and expressiveness as we read and respond to a range of historical and contemporary texts.

This Scriptorium focuses on found families. Found families, also called chosen families, refer to forms of kinship and closeness that go beyond one’s immediate biological relations. Because found families highlight non-traditional ways of building community and overcoming shared difficulties, they have become an increasingly important and visible aspect of marginalized communities. This course will focus on found families in a variety of contexts, including queer literature and culture, neurodiversity, feminism, and migration. Our readings and media may include primary works by Leslie Feinberg, Audre Lorde, Gloria Anzaldúa, Stephanie Burt, Casey Plett, Lianka Finck, Alison Bechdel, Ash Kreis, Hayao Miyazaki, Viet Thanh Nguyen, TJ Klune, Rebecca Sugar; and critical works by Eve Sedgwick, Elizabeth Freeman, Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, Cárol Mejía, and Kath Weston.",Alex Creighton,2000-level,,Fully in-person,4,15,"Broadly speaking, this class will teach you how to engage with the discipline and practice of critical essay-writing.

*	Writing and Revision. You will practice the skills that come with writing insightful essays, including analyzing texts, weaving analysis into an argument, writing thesis statements and topic sentences, and finding a compelling structure for your ideas. You will also practice grammar and revision skills that help you express those ideas with clarity and precision.
*	Working with Critical Sources. You will learn to research online and in Crossett Library, read and annotate critical sources, and put sources in conversation with your own ideas and with other criticism.
